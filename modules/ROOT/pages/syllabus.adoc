== Syllabus

This is the attempt to collect e-procurement/ZUGFeRD/XRechnung/Factur-X
related training topics and texts under a free license (public domain).

Currently we’re collecting topics and why they may be important.
Fundamentally it’s a german view but it can be extended to other
countries.

Until we have conducted more trainings and can better specify the
content and time needed for each chapter we will put A-C if it’s a
small, medium or large topic.

An example of a good syllabus is the
https://istqb-main-web-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/media/documents/ISTQB_CTFL_Syllabus-v4.0.pdf[ITSQB
syllabus] and we might later use their learning levels

* K1: Remember
* K2: Understand
* K3: Apply

Attributes: Dependencies, how long, how important, how interactive, how
known, how autonomous, how popular

===

=== *Legal and compliance*

The European legal situation for e-procurement, in particular in Germany
for B2G invoices

### *GoBD* The european legal situation for e-orders
and e-invoices, in particular in Germany for B2G invoices

### *Auditing requirements*
The auditing requirements of the GoBD vis a vis tools to
store e-invoices, their processes, their backups and their as well as
their unalterability

### *Invoice retention*
How long invoices have to
be made available before their archival

### *Procedural documentation*
The requirements of the GoBD as regards to procedural documentation
e.g. of the decision if the XML or the PDF-part of an invoice be
processed

### *VAT regulations*
Why and how the legislation of identical
copies (Inhaltsgleiche Mehrstücke) affected Factur-X/ZUGFeRD

### *EU/2014/55* Directive EU/2014/55 of the European Commision was the
start of a unified requirement vis a vis all European member countries
to be able to process electronic invoices

### *EN16931*
CEN EN16931-1 –
EN16931-5 is the standard to aid EU/2014/55. We will have a look e.g. at
the eligible syntaxes and the calculation rules.

### *E-Government-Gesetz*
The german E-Government-Gesetz is the german
ratification of EU/2014/55 and additionally to enforcing the authorities
to accept e-invoices, it also prohibits most vendors to further send
paper invoices

### *E-Rechnungs-VO*
The E-Rechnungs-Verordnung aids the
E-Government-Gesetz and e.g. established deadlines until when the
migration has to take place.

### *E-Rechnungen international*
We’ll have
a look at special requirements of certain countries, e.g. digital
signature (Hungary) or Rappenrundung (Switzerland)

### *Gross price definition*
In germany, gross is often translated as Brutto, including
VAT that conflicts with the definition in EN16931, CII and UBL where
gross is more of a basic list price, without VAT

### *Substitutional scans*
The GoBD imposes certain requirement on the processes and tools
if paper invoices are to be destroyed after their scan.

### *Invoice Recognition and ZUGFeRD* We cover the topic if and how potentially
incomplete OCRs can still build a valid Factur-X file and if profiles
are upwards compatible.

### *Paper-hidden requirements*

Some XML
requirements, like VAT type codes, are now required and were never
displayed on any paper invoice.

### *Reminders* ###
How to remind your
customers to pay an invoice, with and without fee

### *B2B: Continuous Transaction Controls*

FatturaPA, How Italy introduced B2B e-invoicing,
how France introduces B2B-e-invoicing, CTC models, situation in Germany


## *History and generic info*
How the standards have evolved and what
are their purposes

### *EDI, EDIFACT and APERAK*
Electronic Data Interchange, EDI, combines the meaning of a format with the addressing
and exchange of a protocol. Despite being more complex, EDI is much
older than XML based e-invoicing, and still in use today. The
introduction of (international) e-invoicing standards in germany in fact
dates back to the 1977 introduction of EDIFACT.

### *APERAK* The XML
Application error and acknowledgement messages can be used to signal
acceptance or rejection of invoices
### *unstructured vs structured invoices*
Unstructured invoices are human-readable (e.g. image files,
TIFF, PDF even with OCR layer), structured invoices are machine readable
(e.g. XML files). Unstructured invoices are generally easier to obtain,
e.g. by scanning paper invoices, but they can not be processed
automatically.

### *UN/CEFACT vs UBL* UBL was initiated by the UN/CEFACT
but later replaced by it’s own standard. There are slight differences
between OASIS UBL and UN/CEFACT, their extentability, their governance,
and their institutions.

### *ZUGFeRD v1*
In 2014 ZUGFeRD defined how to
embed XML in PDF to get a hybrid invoice, both structured and
unstructured at the same time. PDF/A was selected as the carrier, a
customized UN/CEFACT CII/2013b for the data and three subsets
(„profiles“) were defined.

### *ZUGFeRD v2*
ZUGFeRD version 2~=Factur-X
version 1 switched UN/CEFACT CII from a customized 2013b to a unchanged
2016b version, introduced first two more profiles and renamed one.
Later, in v2.1.1, the concept of reference profiles were conceived.

### *Factur-X*
Factur-X 1 started as a french fork of ZUGFeRD 2 led by the
FNFE. The „Factur-X namespace“ soon also became the recommended
name(space?) for ZUGFeRD.

### *Order-X*
Order-X is the sister standard
to Factur-X, with in PDF embedded XML of orders instead of invoices.
Process-wise it also supports proposal and acceptance of changes. For
this purpose, UN/CEFACT CrossIndustryOrder 2020b is used, the embedded
file is called Order-X.xml.

### *Deliver-X*
GS1 and BVL were working on
hybrid electronic despatch advices based on UN/CEFACT Cross Industry
Despatch Advice, crossing the gap between orders and invoices, which
will be the basis for the upcoming Deliver-X standard

### *unit codes and other codelists*
The different lists of the different standards for
eligible attribute values have been centralized by the CEF, who
republish them as excel. They are binding for EN16931, i.e. not only CII
but also UBL.

### *XRechnung*

The XRechnung is the requirements
specification of the german government vis a vis electronic invoices.
XML-wise they are mapped to CII and UBL and it makes certain attributes
mandatory, e.g. the postal address of the receiver and a seller contact
as well as the governmental routing number „Leitweg-ID“. Due to
political reasons cash discounts are handled using a proprietary format,
not XML. This lesson clarifies Business Term IDs, how to find them (and
their cardinalities) in ZUGFeRD’s technical appendix, which industry
recommendation exists, what the difference is between the two XRechnung
profiles, how to convert between the XML formats, how to validate
XRechnung, how to visualize them and how they are mapped to Peppol-IDs
to facilitate automatic transmission.

### *Invoice attachments*
Invoice attachments like protocols, bills of material or measurements are added
either as embedded file within the PDF (Factur.-X) or base64-encoded in
the XRechnung.

### *CIUS vs additional data* Core Invoice Usage
Specifications, CIUS, like the german XRechnung, can make optional
attributes mandatory, Andreas Starke’s additional data can cater
additional structured attributes for electronic invoices.

### *Industry recommendations*

E.g. the Deutsche Bahn or the construction industry has
published requirements vis á vis Xrechnung respective ZUGFeRD files, and
the french Chorus Pro has published requirements both for french B2G as
well as for french B2B invoices.

### *PEPPOL*
PEPPOL is a international
EDI organization, based on UBL messages and the AS/4 protocol, which
implement a four-corner model for their paying customers.
### *E-invoicing vs e-Billing*
E-Billing, in Germany for amounts <150 Eur,
allow amounts with VAT which could otherwise not be expressed,
e.g. 20,20 Eur @ 19%.

### *Document types* Apart from usual invoices,
sometimes there might be need for reminders (not in scope), credit
notes, or corrected invoices. Partial invoice are in scope, collective
invoices (single invoice on multiple orders) only available in certain
profiles.

## *Tools*

### *SDKs*
Open Source SDKs for C++, Java, Python
and PHP are covered

### *Open Source tools*

Open source tools for
Metadata and schema validation

### *Libraries*
Which free libraries can
be used to make software e.g. Factur-X ready

### *Software stack/Creation tools*
Free software and editors which perform
e.g. schema validation for XML authoring

### *Consuming applications*
Free open source private banking software and e-invoice viewers

### *Validators*
Free software to re-calculate invoices and check their
formal correctness

### *Miscellaneous tools*
- E.g. text editors, hex editors and diff tools for XML authoring

=== *XML*

XRechnung and Factur-X/ZUGFeRD consist of XML files, this convers XML’s
validity, in general, tools to validate, address, mix and transform XML
and gives an intro to the two most important XML formats for electronic
invoices, UN/CEFACT Cross Industry Invoice (used for Factur-X/ZUGFeRD
and XRechnung) and UBL (used for XRechnung and Peppol)

==== *Basics*

Basics for XML in general: Charsets and general validity

#### *_Well-formedness_*
Describes how XML is a hierarchical format and what
all XML files must and must not have, as well as a authoring tool to
ensure that

#### *_Schema_*
Schema files also allow to specify which
format e.g. attributes should take, e.g. that the total amount has to
consist of numbers with two decimals.

#### *_UTF8_*
Unicode is the
most important international character encoding for XML, UTF8 is a 8 bit
representation that comes with certain peculiarities, e.g. a possible
Byte Order Mark.

#### *_Namespaces_*
Namespaces are used to blend XML
documents together

### *UN/CEFACT CII, CIO and CIDA*
UN/CEFACT CII is a
standard used for electronic invoices, the „MUG“ has been determined as
it’s european subset. For orders, CIO can be used. The current version,
schema file, the root, the basic elements and the basic namespaces are
described.

### *UBL*
UBL is another XML invoice standard. Alternative
XML structures and why they are deprecated are discussed
(e.g. OpenTrans, FinInvoice). Here as well the current version, schema
file, the root, the basic elements and the basic namespaces are
described.

==== *Xpath*

Xpath is a standard used to find, address and aggregate XML elements and
attributes. Apart from being useful to find invoice data, it plays an
important role when transforming XML (with XSLT) and when validating XML
(using schematron)

#### *_Evaluation_*

Simple Xpath queries and how
to run them on a sample document

#### *_Validators_*

How and why
Schematron uses Xpath to be able to specify tests/validations on XML
files

### *XSLT*
XSL transformations allow to transform any XML file in
one format into anotther file in the same, or a different format.

#### *_Saxon_*
Saxon is a powerful open source engine to apply XSLT 1.

#### *_Apache FOP_*
Apache FOP can be used to generate PDF from a particular
XML format, called „Formatting Objects“ (FO), so a XML file can be
translated into PDF

### *Schematron* Schematron files use Xpath to be a
much more powerful validation than mere Schema files can do, allowing
e.g. mathematical operations like the total amount has to match the sum
of the items. Which e-invoice related schematron files are published
where is part of this lesson.

#### *_Validate using XSLT_*
Schematron
rules can be converted to format specific XSLT files, in which case the
XSLT transformation output is a XML validation report of the input file
against the given Schematron rules. This lesson shows how this can be
done to obtain validation reports.

### *Codelists*
Codelists specify
possible attribute values, e.g. „H87“ as unit code for „piece“. Which
e-invoice related codelists are published where and which versions are
relevant is part of this lesson. 1.

## *PDF*

PDF is the second pillar of
hybrid invoices

### *Basics*
Like XML, PDF is a hierarchical format, but
with references, binary data and compression

### *Creation*
Ghostscript
is one of the very few free open source tools capable of converting PDF
to PDF/A. It is often used in virtual PDF printing software and actually
Ghostscript can read and process PDF files so well that it is
occasionally used to fix even corrupted PDFs. Even Factur-X comliant
PDF/A-3 can be created with Ghostscript.

### *Structure analysis*
Open-Source tools like itext RUPS, Exiftool, or the structure view of
the commercial Acrobat Pro highlight the internal hierachy or metadata
within the PDF files.

### *PDF-A*
This lesson will discuss the
difference between PDF and it’s archival counterparts, PDF/A-1 to 4 and
why it is important to at least use PDF/A-1

### *Purpose, ISO Standard*
The knowledge of the aforementioned tools, along with the specifications
(PDF is available, PDF/A costs money) can help to make files valid and
more readable

==== *Validation, e.g. using VeraPDF*

VeraPDF is a open source Validator for PDF/A as the common PDF standard
has evolved so much that validation is de facto no longer possible.

### *File attachments, PDF/A Schema extensions and RDF Metadata*
Within
PDF/A, file attachments are available since A-3, this lesson also has a
look at the A-3 subset a, u and b, as well as PDF/A-4‘s „f“ subsubset.

## *Mustang*

How Mustang can be used and embedded

### *Reading*
How to
use the command line tool to extract XML from Factur-X/ZUGFeRD

### *Writing*

Use the command line tool to combine XML and PDF to
Factur-X/ZUGFeRD and Order-X

### *Validation*

Validation with the
command line tool, meaning of the error types. How to follow up on
rounding errors.

### *Conversion*
How the commandline can be used to
convert ZUGFeRD from v1 to v2, from CII to UBL and (for the purpose of
visualization) from CII to HTML. How Mustang can be used in automated
tests.

### *Visualization*

==== *Quba*

==== *Integration*

How to embed the Mustang Library and the Mustang validator in Java
software. How to facilitate checks (and tests, e.g. the HATE test) if
the calculation match. How XRechnung can be extracted from the invoice
class and how invoices can be parsed either coarse or fine.

.Exercises could include
* Use Mustang to extract, combine, convert to HTML or UBL and/or validate
* Use Kosit to validate XRechnung
* Use Kosit to display HTML, PDF
* How to apply schematron the XSLT way
* How to identify a rounding error in the schematron
